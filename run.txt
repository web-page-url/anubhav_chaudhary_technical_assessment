# Project Run Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)

## 1. Backend Setup (FastAPI)
The backend handles pipeline parsing and execution logic.

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd backend

2. Install dependencies (it is recommended to use a virtual environment):
   pip install fastapi uvicorn

3. Start the server:
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

The backend will run on http://localhost:8000.

## 2. Frontend Setup (React)
The frontend provides the visual pipeline builder.

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   npm start

The application will open at http://localhost:3000.

## 3. Usage & Features

### Creating Pipelines
- Drag and drop nodes from the **Node Library** toolbar.
- Connect nodes by dragging wires from source handles (right) to target handles (left).
- **New Nodes Available:**
  - **Math**: Perform operations (+, -, *, /, ^) on inputs or values.
  - **Condition**: Logic gate (True/False paths).
  - **Transform**: Modify text (Uppercase, Reverse, Trim, etc.).
  - **Filter**: Pass data conditionally based on a filter value.
  - **Timer**: Simulate delays.

### Running Pipelines
1. Click the **"Run Pipeline"** button at the bottom of the screen.
2. If you have any **Input Nodes**, you will be prompted to enter values for them.
3. The pipeline executes on the backend.
4. A **Results Modal** will appear showing:
   - Whether the pipeline is a valid DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
   - Number of nodes and edges.
   - Execution time.
   - Outputs for every node (Output nodes are highlighted).

### Managing Nodes
- **Delete**: Hover over any node and click the **"×"** button in the top-right corner to remove it (and its connections).
- **Text Node**: Type `{{variableName}}` inside a Text Node to dynamically create an input handle for that variable.
